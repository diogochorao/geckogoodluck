One afternoon, a few years ago, I was taking a walk through the suburbs of my hometown with some friends. We walked into a large department store that was having a going-out-of-business sale, 50% off everything. I contemplated buying a cheap childrens' keyboard, thinking I might get some interesting sounds out of it, but ended up deciding that, even at half price, I was most likely not gonna use it enough to make it worth the money (looking back, I was probably wrong, but I couldn't have known – and you know what? I can't regret making a financially responsible decision). I tried on a couple of funny hats, picked up some AA batteries (can't remember what I needed them for), and just before leaving, in the second to last corridor, a paperweight caught my attention. It was a small stone, with an even smaller gecko lying on top of it. Under the gecko, painted on the side of the stone, were the words "GECKO GOOD LUCK". I marveled at it with my friends, and then noticed it only cost 50 cents (25 with the 50% discount!), so I bought two – one with a white gecko and white letters on a black stone, and the other one reversed. I gave the first one to my brother, and the other one to my girlfriend. A friend of mine bought one too, and there were none left on the shelf. I haven't seen anything like it again.
